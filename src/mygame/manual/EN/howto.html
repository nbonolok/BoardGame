    <h3> Game Rules</h3>
    <p align="justify"> 1) The rules to be used are  the Generally Accepted Rules (GAR), as follows:
        Play consists of three stages:
      <br />
      </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>STAGE  1:</strong>
      <br />
        <ol>Each player starts with 12  tokens called &quot;cows&quot;. <br />
        Starting with a clear board,  each player alternatively places one cow at a time on a junction (circle). The  aim is to create rows of three, either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally.  Cows may only be placed on unoccupied junctions. <br /></ol>
        <ol>When three-in-a-row is  achieved, the player may remove (shoot) one of the opponent's cows. A player  can not shoot an opponent's &quot;three-in-a-row&quot; cows if there are other  cows on the board left to shoot. <br />
        Only one of the opponent's  cows may be shot at a time, even if two (or more) lines of three-in-a-row are  achieved with one move. <br />
      Once a cow is shot, it shall  not be used in play again.
      <br /></ol>
      </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>STAGE 2 </strong>
      <br />
       <ol> When all twelve cows of each  player have been placed on the board, cows may be moved from one junction to  another. A move consists of moving a cow from one junction to an unoccupied  junction immediately linked and adjacent to that junction. <br /></ol>
      <ol>Players may break their own  lines of three-in-a-row in order to make new lines, or simply reposition their  cows. <br />
        Cows may be moved back and  forth to the same two junctions repeatedly. A three-in-a-row may be made,  broken and remade repeatedly. <br />
      Each time a three-in-a-row  is remade, an opponent's cow shall be shot.
       <br /></ol>
                </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>STAGE  3</strong>
      <br />
      When a player has lost all  but three cows, then a player may move a cow to any vacant junction on the  board with each move. </p>
      <p align="justify"><br />
                </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><em>Winning the game </em></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">
        The game is won when the  opponent cannot move any cows: or when the opponent has lost all but two cows. <br />
        When a player is down to  three cows, and neither player is able to shoot an opponent's cow within ten  moves, the game is a draw.</p>

        </p>
    </div>
  
    
    <p>STEP 1: LOADING BOARD GAME WITH TOKENS (COWS)</p>
    
    <p>Player 1 goes first  then player2 follows on every game event that must occur. <br />
       All 12 pieces of each  player must be moved from the docking panel to the board.<br/>
       Click on the game board node which is not occupied to place a token.</p>
    <br/> 
    <ol>If destination is not a valid game board node,A   warning dialog will be displayed and a move will be discarded.</ol>
     <ol>If destination is occupied, A warning Message dialog will be displayed and  player move discarded.</ol>
     <ol> Else a game piece is placed at location  selected by the player and docking panel Dikgomo decreased by 1;</ol>
      <ol>Repeat steps 1 to 3 between Player 1 and  Player 2 until Dikgomo (tokens ) pieces numbers at the docking panel is equal to Zero.</ol>
    
    <p>STEP 2:MOVING TOKENS (COWS) ON THE BOARD
    <ol>Player 1 starts then  player 2 follows using the same rules. </ol>
   <ol>Click on a Token (Cow) that must be moved.</ol>
    <ol>Next click on an Empty mhele game node which is not occupied.</ol>
    <ol>If a player wants to cancel a move,a Player can click on any location on the game board.</ol></td>
